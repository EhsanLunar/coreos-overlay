This is a package for go-tspi. It's a package specific for Flatcar,
thus not packaged by Gentoo. Updating the package usually means
changing the EGIT_COMMIT variable in the ebuild to a commit ID from
https://github.com/coreos/go-tspi. So most of the maintenance of this
package happens actually in the project's git repo.
