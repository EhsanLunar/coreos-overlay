This is a package for torcx. It's a package specific for Flatcar, thus
not packaged by Gentoo. Updating the package usually means changing
the CROS_WORKON_COMMIT variable in the ebuild to a commit ID from
https://github.com/flatcar-linux/torcx. So most of the maintenance of
this package happens actually in the project's git repo.
