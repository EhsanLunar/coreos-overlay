This is a fork of the app-emulation/docker-proxy package from
Gentoo. Looks like that the sole reason for this for is the use of
coreos go eclasses, so it would be good to check if it is still
necessary to use it. Also this package seems to be very outdated -
earlier it used to be updated together with docker.
