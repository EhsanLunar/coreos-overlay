This is a package for updateservicectl. It's a package specific for
Flatcar, thus not packaged by Gentoo. Updating the package usually
means changing the CROS_WORKON_COMMIT variable in the ebuild to a
commit ID from https://github.com/flatcar-linux/updateservicectl. So
most of the maintenance of this package happens actually in the
project's git repo.
